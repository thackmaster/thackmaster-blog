## My Setup
My homelab isn't the most glamorous, but it gets the job done, which is ultimately what matters. A lot of my hardware was rescued or bought from my local community. Let's go over what all is there.

### Compute
- 2 HP EliteDesk 800 G2 (repurposed from a local school district)
    - Intel Core i5-6400T @ 2.2 GHz, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD
    - Intel Core i5-6600T @ 2.7 GHz, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD
- 1 Raspberry Pi 5B: 4GB RAM, 32GB SD Card
- 1 Dell Optiplex 5050: Intel Core i5-7500 @ 3.4 GHz, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD

Almost everything in my homelab runs Debian with the exception of one of my HPs. It's running RedHat on a developer license at the moment. There are plans to test out Fedora server and Unraid at a future time.

### Storage
- Synology NAS DS920+
    - Intel Celeron J4125, 8GB RAM, 2 14TB drives in SHR, 2 4TB drives in RAID1

Pretty much everything within the homelab is stored on my NAS with nightly backups to Backblaze B2.

### Networking
- UniFi Dream Machine Special Edition
- UniFi Switch - Standard PoE 24
- UniFi U6 Mesh Wireless AP (just the one for now)
- 2 UniFi Flex Mini's (desk and entertainment areas)

### Containers
Below is an extensive list of what I host within my homelab. This may not be 100% up-to-date at any given time since it's not well documented (I'm working on it). Almost everything runs in Docker, and I stored my compose files in a [publicly accessible GitHub](https://github.com/thackmaster/homelab). You can find it on my GitHub page.
